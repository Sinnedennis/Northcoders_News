### Setup

1. Ensure that your machine is running Node version 7 or above. To check what version you are running, open a terminal window and type:
    ``` 
    node -v
    ```
    If you do not receive a response in the format of v7.2.1, or your version of Node is older than 7x, [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download and install Node from the official website.
   
2. Ensure you have Node Package Manager (NPM) installed. As above, open a terminal window and type:
    ``` 
    npm -v
    ```
    If you do not receive a response in the format of v5.5.1, or your version of NPM is older than 5x, type the following commands into your terminal:
    ``` 
    npm install npm
    ```
    If you run into any issues with the above steps, [click here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) to follow NPM's official guide to installing Node and NPM.

3. Ensure that your machine is running MongoDB installed and running in a terminal when using the API. To run in your terminal, type this command
    ```
    mongod --version
    ```
    If you do not receive a response in the format of v2.6.12, or your version of NPM is older than 2.6, follow this [guide](https://www.mongodb.com/).

    ```
2. Navigate into the freshly-cloned directory and run:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    In a separate terminal, run the following command to connect to the database. You must let this terminal window idle to maintain the connection.
    ```
    mongod
    ```

## Useage

To start the server run the following command
```
npm start
```
This will run the server on PORT 3090 and can be accessed at http://localhost:3090. I would recommend [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for making local Put, Post, Delete etc requests.

To run the testing suite, type: 
```
npm t
```
